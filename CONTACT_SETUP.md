# Contact Form Backend Setup Guide

## 🎉 Backend Implementation Complete!

Your contact form now has a fully functional backend that will send emails when visitors submit the form.

## 📧 Email Setup Required

To make the contact form work, you need to configure your email settings:

### 1. Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with your email credentials:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your actual email settings:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 2. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

For Gmail, you'll need to use an **App Password** instead of your regular password:

1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Security** → **2-Step Verification**
3. Scroll down to **App passwords**
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Use this app password in your `.env.local` file

### 3. Alternative Email Services

You can also use other email services by modifying the configuration in `/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`:

```typescript
// For Outlook/Hotmail
service: 'hotmail'

// For Yahoo
service: 'yahoo'

// For custom SMTP
host: 'smtp.your-provider.com',
port: 587,
secure: false
```
